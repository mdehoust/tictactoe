# tictactoe

This is a toy project for my own amusement. Some of it is test-driven, some of it is slapped together impatiently with very little discipline.

Try these commands.

```sh
# Play the game using a Swing-based user interface
java -jar tictactoe.jar

# Play the game in your terminal
java -jar tictactoe.jar terminal

# Run a simulation pitting all the player types against each other and dump out some stats
java -jar tictactoe.jar stats
```
